# Identifying Arguments of Space-Time Fractional Diffusion: Data-driven Approach

The code to reproduce results in our paper from Frontiers 2020. [Paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fams.2020.00014)

**Language:** The code package is available in Python and Matlab

*Note:* We have observed that the Matlab generated alpha-stable distribution samples are more close to the theoretical moments as compared to the scipy (Python) generated at the time the experiments were done. We leave up to the user to decide which option to use.
